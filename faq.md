# FAQ

## General Questions

**How much does Nexus Cost?**\
Nexus is a one-time payment of $100 USD. There are no other transactional fees or subscriptions. This will grant you one license per IP.

**Does Nexus increase my server performance?**\
Nexus doesn't improve any individual server performance. This is purely a distributed server load software.

**Can I have a sample/Trial?**\
Currently, there are no samples or trials available. I can however recommend plenty of large servers that are running it without issue.

**Do we get the source code?**\
Unfortunately no. I do not offer source code for Nexus due to many different factors. There are plenty of configs and customized scripts in Nexus to make it personalized to meet your needs without editing the source.

**How long do you plan on developing/maintaining it?**\
There are no current plans for me to abandon this project. I will pass this along to a qualified individual if and when I do.

**How do I go about making a feature request?**\
The Nexus Discord has a feature request channel where all admins and server owners can discuss additions.

**Does this work with Game Panels like GTXGaming?**\
I do not offer support for game panels nor can I confirm this would work well. Since you have to run the controller 24/7 anyway, you need to have a dedicated machine to run it.

**Can the controller run on Linux/docker?**\
I do not offer support for running anything on Linux/docker. Until the game decides to allow it, I will be sticking with just windows.

**What hardware do I need to run this?**\
Entirely depends on what you plan to do. SE still likes that higher clock speed over cores and can eat ram more than chrome. The controller itself has no noticeable performance impact.

## Setup
**How hard is it to set up and install?**\
It can be very difficult to get it tuned and working right especially if you are unfamiliar with SE & Torch. It is recommended you get your server read with mods and configs before even thinking about Nexus to make sure it's running smoothly before you attempt Nexus.

**I already have a world with players and grids. Can this be transferred?**\
Yes! With some minor additions in the setup, you can easily migrate an existing save into nexus.

**I have a Nexus world but want to go back to a single server setup. Can this be done?**\
Yes, however re-combining grids and voxels into one save will never be exact.

**How do I go about setting up seamless server switching for my cluster?**\
Seamless is always enabled for Nexus servers. Your players will have to set up and install the plugin loader to get the plugin.

**I have two dedicated boxes in different parts of the world. Will Nexus work?**\
Yes. Be careful that the network delay between them isn't too bad.

**Can I use my domain name?**\
Yes. But this will give you headaches down the line as they do not update instantly.

## Tips and Maintenance Help

### Mod/Plugin compatibility & Limitations
**Does every plugin and mod work with nexus?**\
No! Not everything will work flawlessly with Nexus. Most mods and plugins are designed to be run on single servers. I highly recommend testing mods or plugins well in advance of starting your server for compatibility issues. Below are several mods/plugins that don't work with Nexus:
- AIEnabled → NPC identity conflicts
- PaintGunMod → Weird player logic issue
- Essentials → Any sandbox cleaning is a nogo with Nexus. **Please check all essential commands for identity cleanup/sandbox cleaning before starting nexus.**
  
**Is there a server limit? Sector Limit?**\
There are no server or sector hard limits. However, I highly encourage people to aim for fewer servers for less maintenance and headaches down the line. Fewer is better!

**Player limit?**\
There are no player limits. The highest player count I have seen on a Nexus cluster was ~230 peeps by Sigma Draconis

**Can the voting website show all my servers under one system?**\
Sadly No. space-engineers.com uses steam for server voting and that is something that I cannot intercept and group.

### Monetization
**Can I use Tebex with my Nexus Server?**\
Yes under a few conditions:
- You respect other modders' choices with their mods on Tebex. (Defense Shields/WC)
- You do not sell *any designed* nexus features to your players. This includes seamless, gates, locked servers, donator-only sectors etc. If you have questions about this please reach out and ask before doing. I do have the right to pull licenses if this has been broken or the license agreement has been violated.
