# Downloading the NexusV3 Controller

The Nexus Controller is required for all Nexus systems. The latest version (NexusV3) is a paid software that can be purchased by visiting the Pricing page above. There are several tiers you can buy depending on your community' needs. After purchasing you will be redirected to show your license key and controller download link.

It is ideal to place the controller in its own folder as it will generate folders at the bin-level directory.

## Server Tiers

NexusV3 is tiered depending on how many torch servers you plan to add to the controller. All purchases are one-time only and upgrades can be possible later by opening a ticket in the Nexus Discord.

The goal for the tiered system was to provide an entry-level framework for smaller communities who want to try the system, but may not need or plan to run a ton of servers. Larger communities may opt to purchase the unlimited server count as they are well supported in player donations.

## Hardware & System Requirements

The Nexus Controller uses less than 1 GB of RAM when running and has almost no CPU performance impact. You can run this on any machine in your network.

While Nexus doesn't increase individual server performance, it does allow you to distribute players and entities across many different torch servers and physical server boxes on the same network or different networks.

You will need to plan your torch instances separately as these can widely vary depending on use.

Nexus is officially only supported on Windows 10 and up including Windows Server 2016 and up.

# Downloading the NexusV3 Torch Plugin

You can download the NexusV3 torch plugin from the torch website through the torch plugin installer or manually. Please make sure no previous versions of Nexus are installed as these systems do not work concurrently.
