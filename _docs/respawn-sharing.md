# Respawn Sharing
NexusV2 had the option to include sharing respawns by inserting faction tags or player steamIDs into any medical respawn block's custom data. NexusV3 includes the same feature, however we have fixed the exploitation with ownership changes. Now on ownership changes, the customdata of any Medical block will be wiped!
