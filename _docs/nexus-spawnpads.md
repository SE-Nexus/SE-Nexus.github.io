# Nexus SpawnPads

Nexus SpawnPads were designed to be a more interactive spawning system for servers. Get rid of those lame spawn screens and create some unique encouters for players in your servers! Spawn pads are highly customizable through the scripting system and API methods that are exposed.

Communities often use the spawn pads in a lobby type enviroment for starting players to use. Since lobbies are no longer have to be an unsectored enviroment, more options are available to you for a more fluid spawning experience.

Think of a station above a starting planet... using the scripts and prefabs you could spawn a ship on a connector and then spawn the player in that ship to act as a drop-pod. Scripting also further provides you the tools to randomize loot in spawnship or randomize damange to armor blocks for essentially a unique spawn ship everytime. You also have access to certain nexus information concerning the player and the spawnpad to do things based off of individual pad uses etc.
